# Hydrolix data source for Grafana

The Hydrolix data source plugin integrates Hydrolix with Grafana, enabling seamless querying, analysis, and
visualization of Hydrolix data.

## Install the plugin

To install the Hydrolix data source plugin:

1. Open the [Grafana Plugin Catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/).
2. Search for **Hydrolix Data Source**.
3. Select the plugin and click **Install Plugin**.

After installation:

1. In Grafana, go to **Connections > Data Sources > Add new data source**.
2. Select **Hydrolix** from the list.

> For more details about installation, see
> Grafana’s [Plugin management documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/plugin-management/).

## Configure the data source

You can configure the Hydrolix data source directly within Grafana or via configuration files.

Following is the list of Hydrolix configuration options:

### Provision the data source

To provision the Hydrolix data source using Grafana’s provisioning system, define it in a YAML configuration file.

Below are some provisioning examples.

#### Using HTTPS protocol

```yaml
apiVersion: 1

  - name: "Hydrolix"
    type: "hydrolix-hydrolix-datasource"
    jsonData:
      host: localhost
      port: 443
      protocol: http
      secure: true
      username: username
      path: /query
    secureJsonData:
      password: password
```

#### Using native protocol

```yaml

## Querying the data source

The query editor in Grafana enables powerful SQL querying with convenient syntax enhancements through macros and
templates.

### SQL query editor

The editor provides extensive SQL capabilities, featuring:

- Intelligent autocompletion for databases, tables, columns, and SQL syntax.
- Template variable and macro support.
- Code formatting.

#### Keyboard shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + Return` - Run the query.

### Macros

To simplify syntax and to allow for dynamic parts, like date range filters, the query can contain macros.

| Macro                                        | Description                                                                                                           | Output example                                                                                        |

Below is an example of a query with the `$__timeFilter` macro:

```sql
SELECT $__timeInterval(log_time) AS time, avg(cpu_usage) AS value
FROM logs
WHERE $__timeFilter(log_time)
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

### Ad hoc filters

Ad hoc filters allow flexible,  column-value filtering dynamically applied across queries. These filters are injected into
queries via the `$__adHocFilter` macro, which must be explicitly included in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT $__timeInterval(log_time) AS time, avg(cpu_usage) AS value
FROM logs
WHERE $__timeFilter(log_time) AND $__adHocFilter()
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

The plugin ensures filters are applied only when valid for the selected table.

#### Configure ad hoc filters

To enable ad hoc filters, both the data source and the dashboard must be configured properly:

1. In the data source settings (under _Advanced Settings_):

   - **Ad-hoc filter table variable name**: the name of a dashboard variable that defines the table used to retrieve column
     names and their values for ad hoc filters.
   - **Ad-hoc filter time column variable name**: the name of a dashboard variable that defines the time column to use for
     time filtering when retrieving ad hoc filter values.
   - **Ad-hoc filter default time range**: a default time range to use when the dashboard’s time range is unavailable.

2. In the target dashboard, create two variables using the exact names defined in the data source settings:
   - A variable for the table name.
   - A variable for the time column.

> **Note:** Ad hoc filters will not work unless both the data source and the dashboard are configured correctly. Be sure
> to match variable names precisely.

####  Empty and null values

Ad hoc filters support two synthetic values to help identify and query rows with missing or blank data:

- `__null__`: matches rows where the column value is `NULL`.
- `__empty__`: matches rows where the column value is an empty string.

These synthetic values appear in the ad hoc filter suggestions only if the underlying data contains `NULL` or empty
strings for the selected column during the current dashboard time range.

If the data contains literal values such as `__null__` or `__empty__`, those will also be matched by the corresponding
filters.

#### Wildcards

Ad hoc filters support wildcard filtering using the `=~` and `!~` operators. These operators allow matching or excluding
values based on simple patterns that include the `*` wildcard character. Full regular expressions are not supported.

The `*` symbol matches any sequence of characters, including an empty one. For example, `*user*` will match any value
that contains the substring user, regardless of what comes before or after.

To match a literal asterisk (`*`), escape it with a backslash (`\*`). For example, to search for the exact string
`*debug*`, enter: `\*debug\*`.

To apply a wildcard filter:

1. On the dashboard, click inside the filter field. 
2. Select the column you want to filter, such as `message`. 
3. Choose the operator `=~` or `!~`. 
4. Type your full wildcard pattern, for example `*user*`.
5. Do not select any of the suggested values while typing.
6. As you type, an option appears at the bottom of the suggestion list: `Use custom value: *user*`.
7. Click this option to apply the filter.

### Round timestamps

To control how time ranges are aligned, `$from` and `$to` timestamps can be rounded to the nearest multiple of the round
value, set in the query editor or in the data source settings.

When a round value is set in the query editor, it takes precedence and is always used. If no round is set in the query editor,
the data source falls back to the default round, if it is configured and non-zero. If neither is set, or if the round value
in the query editor is explicitly set to `0`, no rounding is applied and the original timestamps are used as-is.

The supported time units for rounding are: `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), and `h` (hours).

#### Examples

| Default round | Query round | Effective round | Input timestamp | Rounded timestamp |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `5m`          | _not set_   | `5m`            | `10:07:20`      | `10:05:00`        |
| `5m`          | `1m`        | `1m`            | `09:02:30`      | `09:03:00`        |
| _not set_     | _not set_   | _not applied_   | `08:01:23`      | `08:01:23`        |
| `5m`          | `0`         | _not applied_   | `07:45:50`      | `07:45:50`        |

### Template variables

Hydrolix queries fully support Grafana's template variables, allowing the creation of dynamic and reusable dashboards.
